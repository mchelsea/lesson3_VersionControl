            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is version control? Version control is a system (VCS) that allows users to record changes of a file, or many files, over time. Users can recall previous versions of the file(s) they are editing. This ensures that files aren’t overwritten and lost during the editing process. It’s possible to do this on any computer, but Git makes this especially easy. There are many types of version control systems, such as local version control, centralized, and distributed. Local version control allows users to keep files with different patches, and can re-create a file by combining all the saved patches. Centralized version control systems are helpful for collaboration; distributed VCSs fully mirror repositories, so if any server dies, there is still a full backup of the data.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source version control system that can handle large projects. It is a distributed revision control system, which means that many people can collaborate on a given project without requiring them to share a common network. These revisions are stored in distributed revision control systems. The previously mentioned patches in topic one are exchanged from peer to peer, which is different from a centralized control system – there is no need to communicate with a central server (there are multiple central repositories). Each copy also functions as a remote backup and its change history, which protects from data loss.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many advantages of using a version control system. It is important when working on major projects, whether it be at a job or for personal projects, that data is not lost. When working with others, it’s possible to lose code and thus, capital invested into projects. With a VCS in place, there is no fear that when working collaboratively, that files can be overwritten by collaborators. People in the team can work on files, anywhere, any time. Later, all these files can be used to merge into one singular file. These version control systems like Git have organized systems that require no time spent organizing files on your (or your team’s) part.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has both local and remote repositories. The previously mentioned “central” repositories is unlike a centralized VCS – there isn’t one. A local repository has the same features and functionality as a git repository on Github. There isn’t a central repository for doing work. The local repository specifically refers to a copy saved on your local machine (on your own computer), while the remote repository is any other type of repository. On Git, this is essentially where your code is stored. The URL could be your repository on GitHub, another user’s, or on a different server.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Continuing the note of version control system GitHub, there are several git commands that are helpful in managing files on Git’s repositories. Git is like a tree with branches, where the branches are contributions. The git commands can help you navigate this same tree. These commands help you add and modify files, create and merch branches, share your code to remote repositories, and other functions. “git commit” can record changes to your repository, and adds them to your index. Git has an index that allows users to add series of files into your working directory, instead of committing file changes all at once.</p>
